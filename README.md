# Data Structures in Java
This repo is a compilation of common data structures, written in easy-to-read Java. I briefly discuss the runtime of each method in every structure, as well as the reasoning behind it. Eventually, I hope to provide as many implementations of each data structure as possible, but for now, here are a few of the most common. 
These data structures are written generically and are ready-to-use/play with! Each folder comes with a Makefile to compile the data structures within them. 

### What's Included:
* Singly linked list
* Doubly linked list
* Stack (with arrays)
* Stack (with linked lists)
* Queue (with linked lists)
* HashTable (with ArrayLists)
* Binary Search Tree (coming soon!)

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
### Play:
I've included main methods in each data structure class that samples various methods. To run, type the following into your terminal:
```
>>> git clone https://github.com/jonathanhchiu/DataStructures.git
>>> cd Hashtable
>>> make run
```
Make sure you have JDK and Makefile (optional) installed!
