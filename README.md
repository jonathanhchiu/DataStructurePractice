# Data Structures in Java
This repo is a compilation of common data structures, written in easy-to-read Java. I've also briefly discussed the runtime complexity of notable methods for each data structure. Eventually, I hope to provide as many implementations of each data structure as possible, but for now, here are a few of the most common. 
These data structures are written with Java's generics and are ready-to-use/play with! Each folder comes with a Makefile to compile the data structures within them. 

### What's Included:
* Singly linked list
* Doubly linked list
* Stack (with arrays and linked lists)
* Queue (with linked lists)
* HashTable (with ArrayLists)
* Binary Search Tree (recursive)

### Play:
I've included main methods in each data structure class that samples various methods. To run, type the following into your terminal:
```
>>> git clone https://github.com/jonathanhchiu/DataStructures.git
>>> cd Hashtable
>>> make run
```
Make sure you have JDK and Makefile (optional) installed! I am developing on Java version 8, update 11.

### Thanks!
Jonathan Chiu
