# Data Structures in Java
This repo is a compilation of common data structures, written in easy-to-read Java. I briefly discuss the runtime of each method in every structure, as well as the reasoning behind it. Eventually, I hope to provide as many implementations of each data structure as possible, but for now, here are a few of the most common. 
These data structures are written generically and are ready-to-use/play with! Each folder comes with a Makefile to compile the data structures within them.
